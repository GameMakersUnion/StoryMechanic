###Gameplay
N/A. This is a [Twine](http://twinery.org/)-based story, like those [choose your own adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) stories with branching plots, with a [story engagement curve](http://solest.org/images/misc/pacing_01_star_wars.gif) with an average upward direction. Some plots branch decisions lead to an immediate end game, and there's multiple endings.

###Setup
Flow chart accessible via Twine. Later may evolve into story game.
